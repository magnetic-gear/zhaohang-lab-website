I got my master's degree in the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academic of Sciences(CASIA) in 2023.Prior to studying in CASIA,I received my B.E degree from School of Automation in Beijing Institute of Technology in 2016. My research interests include  trajectory planning and motion control with collaborative manipulators, especially in the field of unified impedance/admittance compliant control in interactive contact tasks. In my leisure time, I like reading classic works of literature and enjoy running or jogging. My personal website is:  https://lkacademic.netlify.app/

Liu Liyang received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, joined the AMDT Laboratory at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in 2023. Her research focuses on the surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization design of high-efficiency motors across multiple physical fields. Her work includes the topological design of asymmetric rotor interior permanent magnet synchronous motors, motor optimization methods based on improved Latin hypercube sampling, surrogate model generation through motor structural analytical transfer, and local motor surrogate model generation based on spatial attenuation.

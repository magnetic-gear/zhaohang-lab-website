I am Xiangdong Su, I was born in Shandong, China. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in mechanical engineering from Shandong University in 2017 and 2020, respectively. After completing my master's degree, I joined SAIC Motor Corporation Limited in Shanghai, China, as an assistant engineer. 

Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Guangzhou, China. My research interests include the analytical calculation, multiphysics analysis and surrogate model-driven optimization of permanent-magnet machines. 

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton and tennis in my free time and find them to be rewarding and enjoyable hobbies.
